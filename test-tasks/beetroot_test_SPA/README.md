# Beetroot test SPA

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io) and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
I was trying to follow [John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1) Angular 1.* style guide.

Please, follow through these simple steps to raise up this Test projects.

Use .cmd or git bash for Widnows and terminal for Mac OS
Please, notice, that Node.js and npm package manager are required. I have node v.5.50 and npm 3.3.12 already installed on my Mac.

So, lets rock!))

In root directory were you want to save my test Single Page Application run these commands:

 1. git clone https://github.com/aquile/beetroot_test_SPA.git
 2. npm install -g strongloop
 3. cd beetroot_test_SPA/
 4. npm install
 5. node .

 If you saw:

 Web server listening at: http://localhost:3000
 Browse your REST API at http://localhost:3000/explorer

 then I wish you to be healthy, wealthy and smiling a lot))!
 REST API is OK and now you can go to the client side.



Open git bash in beetroot_test_SPA/client/beetroot_SPA for Windows or press Command+T for Mac OS and type cd /client/beetroot_SPA in terminal
and follow the steps below:

 1. Smile)) and type:
 2. npm install
 3. npm install -g bower
 4. bower install
 5. npm install -g gulp
 6. gulp serve

 Enjoy))
